   - module environment setting✅
   - Create Data Visualization View✅
   - Create User Action View✅

3. Add compoent to website✅

4. Aizine deployment✅

# Plan

## 1. Purpose

17 sustainable development goals presented by the United Nations are aimed at addressing many of the social issues facing the planet, along with COVID-19.

For this, wonderful services, printed materials, and videos are being produced.

We came up with the idea of a "Data simulation app" to make it easier for people to access these issues and provide maximum emotion.

Infographic designs and videos can inspire people, but I thought putting more interactive elements would give them greater inspiration and motivation.

## 2. description

- The purpose is to create multiple components on the front end of the web.
- Among the 17 sustainable development goals, we will make the first of the topic presented by Angelhack's.

```
AngelHack seoul Challenges

- GOAL 4: QUALITY EDUCATION (패스트캠퍼스)
- GOAL 11: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES (테이블매니저)
- GOAL 12: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION (우아한형제들)
- GOAL 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (코드스테이츠)
```

- The final goal is to make all 17 of them.
- It's an open source project.
- Anyone can provide simulation ideas of 17 sustainable development goals, and can develop too.

# Business model

- The business model for open source projects is the 'premium model'. It's free in principle, but We're going to charge according to the size of the website that uses the component.
